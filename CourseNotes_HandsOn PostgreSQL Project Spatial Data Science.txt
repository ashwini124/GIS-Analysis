-----------------------------------------------
Understanding coordinate systems in geospatial analysis
-----------------------------------------------
Maps as Models: Maps are approximations of Earth's surface. All models are inherently imperfect.

Earth's Shape:
The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but an ellipsoid (a smooth, simplified shape) or geoid (a more accurate shape considering gravitational variations).
Ellipsoid is easier to work with but less precise; geoid is more accurate but complex and unnecessary for most mapping projects.

Coordinate Systems:
Geographic Coordinate System (GCS): Uses latitude and longitude to pinpoint locations globally. Ideal for global-scale maps (e.g., COVID-19 map), but not suitable for measuring distances or areas due to Earth's curvature distortion.
Projected Coordinate System (PCS): Projects the Earth's 3D surface onto a 2D plane. It is better for spatial analysis like measuring distances and areas.
UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator): A commonly used projected system for smaller regions, reducing distortion in local areas.
Conic and Cylindrical Projections: Different projection methods preserving various spatial properties (e.g., area, shape, distance).

Choosing the Right Projection:
Local Projects (e.g., city-level analysis): Use a local projection like UTM to minimize distortion in smaller areas.
Global Analysis: Use a global system like WGS 84 (World Geodetic System 1984).
Example: For NYC projects, UTM Zone 18N (meters as units) is suitable for precise measurements.
Case Study: Map Projection Errors:
The Economist (2003) used a Mercator projection to show North Korea's missile range, distorting distances and areas. They later corrected it by using geodesic buffers, which are more accurate for long distances.

Key Takeaways:
Choosing the wrong coordinate system or map projection can lead to significant distortions in spatial data.
For local projects, use a local projection like UTM; for global analysis, use WGS 84. 


-----------------------------------------------
Introduction to vector data for spatial analysis
-----------------------------------------------
Vector Data Basics:
Represents geographic features using points, lines, and polygons.
Point: Single location (e.g., bus stop, fire hydrant), defined by coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Line: Series of connected points, used for linear features like rivers, roads, power lines.
Polygon: Closed shape of connected points, used for areas like lakes, parks, city boundaries.

When to Use Vector Data:
Used for discrete features with clear boundaries or specific locations (e.g., roads, buildings).
Ideal for precise analysis (e.g., measuring distances, areas, and defining boundaries).
Allows representation of both location and attributes (e.g., school names, types, and student populations tied to geographic locations).

Common Vector Data Formats:
Shapefile: Widely used, efficient, but limited to simpler geometries and can't handle large datasets (max size ~2GB). Typically comes with multiple related files.
GeoJSON: Web-friendly, code-friendly format used for sharing geospatial data online. Supports complex geometries and large datasets.
GeoParquet: New format designed for large spatial datasets, built on Apache Parquet (a format for big tabular datasets). The first release was in September 2023.

Vector Data Analysis:
Spatial Join: Combines two datasets based on location (e.g., combining schools with city districts to see how many schools fall within each district).
Buffering: Creates a zone around a feature at a specific distance (e.g., a one-kilometer buffer around a transit stop to count nearby buildings).
Service Area Analysis: Uses transportation/road data to calculate accessible areas (e.g., how many houses are within one kilometer of a transit station).
Intersection Analysis: Identifies where two or more features overlap (e.g., roads intersecting floodplain data to assess flood risk).

PostGIS:
Vector data can be stored and queried efficiently using PostGIS, a spatial extension of PostgreSQL.
PostGIS allows indexing and efficient querying of large datasets (e.g., city infrastructure, road networks, environmental data).
Next Steps: The course will explore raster data in the next lesson, used to represent continuous surfaces like elevation, temperature, or satellite imagery.

Vector data is fundamental in geospatial analysis for precise, boundary-driven features and can be analyzed for relationships and patterns using various spatial operations. 


-----------------------------------------------
Introduction to raster data for spatial analysis
-----------------------------------------------
Raster Data Overview:
Represents continuous surfaces (e.g., temperature, elevation, vegetation) that change gradually across space.
Composed of a grid of cells (pixels), each with a value representing a specific attribute at that location.
Structured as a matrix with rows and columns.
Resolution: Size of the cell (pixel). Higher resolution = smaller cells, more detail; lower resolution = larger cells, less detail.
Example: Analyzing forest cover in high-resolution raster data allows for individual trees to be seen, while low-resolution data gives a more generalized view.

When to Use Raster Data:
Remote sensing projects (e.g., environmental monitoring, satellite imagery).
Large-scale environmental analysis or visualizing Earth's surface.
Examples of real-world uses:
Post-natural disasters: High-resolution satellite images help locate flooded areas, destroyed buildings, and blocked roads.
Climate monitoring: Organizations like NASA and NOAA use raster data to track global temperature changes and other environmental trends (e.g., shifting vegetation, shrinking ice caps).
Precision agriculture: Use of raster data (e.g., NDVI from satellite imagery) to assess crop health, soil moisture, vegetation density, and predict crop yield. Helps optimize water usage and improve crop productivity.

Common Raster Data Formats:
GeoTIFF: Most common raster format for Earth science data. A geo-referenced image file, meaning each pixel is tied to a specific geographic location.
NetCDF (Network Common Data Form): Used for multi-dimensional datasets (e.g., climate data, precipitation over time). Efficient for large, time-series data.

Challenges with Raster Data:
Large file sizes: High-resolution raster data is detailed but requires substantial storage and computational power.
Approximation and Interpolation: Real-world features don’t align neatly into grid cells, so raster data involves some approximation.
Cloud cover: Clouds can obscure the Earth’s surface, affecting the accuracy of satellite imagery. However, advancements in AI and machine learning are reducing this issue, as these techniques can fill in missing data and help analyze images despite weather conditions.

Key Takeaways:
Raster data is ideal for representing gradients and continuous phenomena, such as temperature or elevation.
Common applications include remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture.
While raster data is powerful, managing its large sizes and ensuring accurate data interpretation (e.g., cloud cover) requires careful consideration.
Though this course focuses on vector data, raster data is crucial for analyzing continuous spatial patterns and is widely used in environmental and remote sensing projects.

Chapter: 2. Building a Geospatial Project
***********************************************

-----------------------------------------------
Overview of the geospatial project
-----------------------------------------------

Project Context:
The project addresses a real-world geospatial problem for Big Apple Bike Share in New York City.
Tasked with solving the imbalance of bike availability between residential and business districts due to the daily commute patterns.

Problem Description:
Residents pick up bikes in areas like Upper East Side and Central Park West and ride to the Financial District in the morning.
In the afternoon, the bike imbalance flips as people return home.

Goal: Ensure bikes are available when and where needed, tackling spatiotemporal imbalance.

Project Objective:
Act as a data analyst to analyze spatiotemporal patterns of bike share ridership.
Solve questions like where bikes are most needed, when to pre-position them, and how to efficiently move bikes.

Data:
Work with synthetic trip data: where and when each trip starts/ends.
Use census tract boundary data to aggregate trip data at the census tract level.

Key Questions:
Which census tracts see the highest bike demand at different times of day?
Where should bikes be pre-positioned before rush hour?
How many bikes should each van carry and which stations should they deliver to?

Outcome:
Gain a deeper understanding of solving spatiotemporal issues using spatial data science for real-world applications.
Apply insights to improve bike share system efficiency. 


-----------------------------------------------
Exploring US census data and NYC trip data
-----------------------------------------------

Objective: Analyze bike demand patterns during rush hours in NYC using two key data sets.

Data Sets:
Trip Data:
Stations File: Information on bike stations (ID, latitude, longitude).
Trips File: Each row represents a bike trip with details like:
Unique trip ID
Start/end time of the trip
Type of bike (electric or mechanical)
Start/end station ID

***********************************************
Chapter: 3. Temporal Operations for Geospatial Analysis
***********************************************

-----------------------------------------------
Data exploration with SQL
-----------------------------------------------

Introduction to SQL for Data Exploration:

SQL queries can provide valuable insights from the data before diving into geospatial analysis.
Key questions can be answered using basic SQL queries.

Key SQL Functions Used:

COUNT(*): To count rows (stations or trips).
CASE WHEN: To apply conditional logic (e-bike count).
GROUP BY: To group data by specific criteria (start station).
AVG(): To calculate average values.
CAST(): To convert data types (from text to timestamp for time subtraction).

Result Summary:
Station Count: 520
Total Trips: 12,000+ for Sept 17
E-bike Usage: 64%
Most Trips Start: Station 7Y6
Average Trip Duration: 12.5 minutes

These SQL queries provide foundational insights into the data, which can guide further spatial analysis and business decisions. 


-----------------------------------------------
Time-based analysis: Grouping trips by half-hour intervals
-----------------------------------------------

Objective:
The goal is to categorize bike trips into half-hour intervals based on their start time. This will help identify usage patterns such as peak times (morning rush, lunch hours, evening) and optimize bike availability or maintenance schedules.

Steps to Solve:

Step 1: Add a New Column for Half-Hour Start Time
Use the ALTER TABLE statement to add a new column that will store the rounded start times for each trip:
This new column will store the trip start times rounded to the nearest half-hour.

Step 2: Calculate and Update the New Column with Rounded Start Times
Use DATE_TRUNC to round the start time to the nearest hour and then use additional logic to determine whether the minute falls in the first or second half of the hour. If it's the second half (minutes 30–59), we add 30 minutes to the truncated time.

Rounds the start_time down to the hour using DATE_TRUNC('hour', start_time).
Adds 30 minutes for times in the second half of the hour (i.e., from minute 30 to 59).

Step 3: Verify the Update

After running the query, refresh the trip_data table to check the new half_hour_start_time column. It should now contain the start times of trips rounded to the nearest half hour.

Benefits of this Approach:

Grouping: This enables easier grouping of trips by time intervals, making it possible to analyze bike usage across different times of day.
Insights: Stakeholders can gain insights into when bikes are most heavily used, helping with operational decisions like bike placement and maintenance scheduling.

This process makes it easy to group and analyze bike trips by half-hour intervals, a crucial step for time-based analysis and understanding usage patterns. 


-----------------------------------------------
Video: Time-based analysis: Analyzing patterns by time of day
-----------------------------------------------

Objective:
We are aiming to analyze bike usage patterns by examining the half-hour intervals when the most trips start, using the half_hour_start_time column created earlier. This will help us identify peak usage times throughout the day, such as rush hours.

Steps to Solve:

Step 1: Query for Half-Hour Intervals
To begin, we need to select the half_hour_start_time and the count of bike trips that started in each half-hour interval. We aggregate the data by half_hour_start_time and order the results by the count of trips in descending order.

Step 2: Explanation of the Query:

Step 3: Query Result:
The result will show the number of trips that started in each half-hour interval, ordered from the busiest time to the least busy. By analyzing this data, we can pinpoint the peak bike usage times of the day.
For example, the busiest times might be around:
Morning Rush: 8:00 to 9:00 AM
Evening Rush: 4:30 to 7:00 PM
Smaller peaks could also be visible, like around noon, with lower activity in the early hours.

This analysis is valuable for stakeholders in bike-share companies. By identifying peak times (morning and evening rush hours, or even midday spikes), companies can better plan for:
Fleet distribution: Ensuring bikes are available during high-demand times.
Maintenance scheduling: Scheduling maintenance during off-peak hours when usage is lower.
Customer service improvements: Enhancing customer experience by aligning bike availability with demand patterns.

Next Step (Spatial Component):
Although time-based analysis provides great insights, spatial analysis is equally important to understand where trips start. This combined spatial-temporal analysis will allow for more advanced decision-making, which will be covered in the next chapter.

In summary, using SQL to group and analyze trips by time intervals provides critical insights into bike usage patterns. By focusing on time-based trends, bike-share companies can optimize operations and improve customer service.

Chapter: 4. Spatial Operations in Geospatial Analysis
***********************************************

-----------------------------------------------
Video: Reproject census tract boundary geometry with PostGIS
-----------------------------------------------

Objective:
The goal is to reproject the census tract boundary geometry data from the WGS 84 coordinate system (SRID: 4326) to the UTM Zone 18N coordinate system (SRID: 32618), which is more suitable for spatial calculations in the New York City area.

Why Reproject?
WGS 84 (SRID: 4326) is a global coordinate system using latitude and longitude, suitable for global mapping, but it isn’t ideal for local geospatial analysis.
UTM Zone 18N (SRID: 32618) is a local projection system that reduces distortion for areas like New York City. It uses meters as units of measurement, which is more suitable for spatial calculations like distance, area, and buffering.

Step-by-Step Process:

Step 1: Inspect the Current Data
The geometry column (e.g., WKB_geometry) of the census tract boundary dataset is currently in the WGS 84 coordinate system (SRID 4326), which uses latitude and longitude.
In DBeaver's Spatial Data Viewer, you can check the data's geometry and confirm that it's stored as a multi-polygon with the SRID 4326 (WGS 84).

Step 2: Reproject the Geometry
To perform geospatial calculations accurately, we need to transform the geometry to the UTM Zone 18N (SRID 32618).
You can achieve this using the ST_SetSRID function to set the SRID to 4326 (if it's not already set), and then the ST_Transform function to convert it to the new projection system (SRID 32618).

Step 3: Verify the Transformation
After running the query, you can refresh the data in DBeaver's Spatial Data Viewer to check if the projection has been correctly updated.
The EPSG code at the bottom of the Spatial Viewer should now reflect 32618 instead of 4326.
Additionally, the geometry column values should now reflect the transformed coordinates in the new projection system (UTM Zone 18N).

Result:
The census tract boundary data is now in the UTM Zone 18N projection, making it ready for spatial analysis like distance calculations, buffering, and spatial joins, which require projections like UTM Zone 18N for accuracy.

Why This Matters:
Reprojecting data ensures that spatial calculations are accurate and reliable. For example, distances between points or areas of polygons can be distorted if the data is not in a proper local projection system. Using UTM Zone 18N for New York City ensures minimal distortion and better precision in geospatial analysis.
In summary, reprojecting geospatial data is a crucial step in preparing data for spatial analysis. With PostGIS functions like ST_Transform and ST_SetSRID, you can easily convert coordinate systems to ones that are more suitable for your analysis, ensuring your results are accurate and actionable. 


-----------------------------------------------
Video: Creating geometric columns and defining projections
-----------------------------------------------
To convert latitude and longitude data into usable spatial data with PostGIS:

Add a Geometry Column:

Create a new column to store geometry data, using a Point type and SRID 4326 (WGS 84) for latitude and longitude.

Populate the Geometry Column:
Use ST_MakePoint to create Point geometries from the longitude and latitude, and ST_SetSRID to assign the SRID 4326.

Reproject the Data:
Transform the geometry from WGS 84 (SRID 4326) to UTM Zone 18N (SRID 32618) for local spatial analysis.

Verification:
Check that the geom column is now populated with transformed point geometries, and verify that the SRID has changed to 32618.

This process allows you to perform spatial queries and analysis on your data in the correct local projection. 


-----------------------------------------------
Video: Spatial ref sys table explained
-----------------------------------------------
The Spatial Reference System (SRS) Table in PostGIS

The Spatial Reference System (SRS) table in PostGIS is crucial for understanding how spatial data is projected and interpreted. It stores information about the various spatial reference systems supported by PostGIS, including the SRID (Spatial Reference Identifier), projection details, and related parameters.

Key Concepts:
SRID (Spatial Reference Identifier):
A unique identifier for a spatial reference system, telling the database how to interpret and project spatial data.
EPSG is a subset of SRID, where EPSG codes are standardized and commonly used SRIDs. For example, SRID 4326 is the widely used EPSG:4326, which corresponds to WGS 84.

EPSG Codes:
EPSG codes are a widely recognized subset of SRIDs, defined by the European Petroleum Survey Group. Most of the time, when people refer to SRIDs like 4326, they are using an EPSG code.

How to Use the SRS Table:
You can query the spatial_ref_sys table to look up details of any spatial reference system by its SRID. 

Finding the Right Projection:
To choose the correct EPSG for your project, tools like epsg.io or projfinder.com can help you identify the best projection for a specific region by either inputting the geographic area or coordinates.

Checking Existing SRID in a Table:
If you're working with existing data and want to know what spatial reference system it uses, you can use the find_srid function. 

This will return the SRID used for the geom column in the nyct2020 table. It’s a useful sanity check to ensure your data uses the correct projection.

Conclusion:
The SRS table helps manage and convert spatial data between different projections, ensuring that spatial analysis is performed accurately. Knowing how to find and use SRID and EPSG codes is essential for working with geospatial data in PostGIS. 


-----------------------------------------------
Video: Spatial analysis: Analyzing patterns with spatial join
-----------------------------------------------
In this spatial analysis, the goal is to determine how many bike trips originated from each census tract. Here's a concise breakdown of the steps:

Spatial Join: Use the ST_Within function to join bike stations (points) with census tracts (polygons), identifying which census tract each station falls into.

Join with Trip Data: Merge the joined station-census tract data with trip data, linking each trip to its corresponding census tract based on the start station.

Aggregate by Census Tract: Group the data by census tract and count the number of trips originating from each tract using COUNT.

Save Results: Store the aggregated data in a new table (census_tract_trip_count) for use in mapping.

Visualization: Use QGIS to create a choropleth map, visualizing the distribution of bike trips across different census tracts.

This analysis allows you to explore spatial patterns in bike ridership and make informed decisions about city planning and infrastructure. 

Conclusion:
By performing a spatial join between the bike stations and census tracts, and then aggregating the trip data, we can analyze the spatial distribution of bike trips. This provides valuable insights into which areas of the city have the highest bike usage, helping with fleet distribution, infrastructure planning, and more. 


-----------------------------------------------
Creating a choropleth map in QGIS
-----------------------------------------------
To create a choropleth map in QGIS using your bike trip data, follow these steps:

Connect to PostgreSQL Database:

Open QGIS, go to PostgreSQL on the left panel, and right-click to create a new connection.
Input your database credentials and test the connection. Once successful, click OK.

Load Data:
After connecting, you'll see your database listed under PostgreSQL. Expand it, navigate to public schema, and double-click on your table (e.g., CT_tripcount 04_04) to load it into QGIS.

Create Choropleth Map:
Right-click the loaded layer and select Properties.
Under the Symbology tab, choose Graduated to map continuous data values (like the number of trips).
Click Classify and check the distribution of your data. If the data is skewed, change the classification method to Natural Breaks for better grouping.

Add a Base Map:
Install the Quick Map Services plugin by going to Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins.
After installation, under the Web menu, select Quick Map Services, and choose OpenStreetMap Standard as your base map to add spatial context to your data.

Result:
You now have a choropleth map where each census tract is colored based on the number of bike trips originating from it. The base map provides context for the geographic layout of New York City. 

-----------------------------------------------
Spatial analysis: Identify nearby stations with a buffer
-----------------------------------------------
In this video, you learn how to optimize van routes for replenishing bike stations by using spatial analysis, specifically with buffers and spatial joins in PostGIS. Here's a concise summary of the process:

Business Objective:
Optimize bike replenishment by identifying nearby stations within a one-kilometer radius of the top three stations with the highest trip volume.

Steps:

Step 1: Identify Top 3 Stations by Trip Volume
Objective: Identify the top three stations where most bike trips originated.
Query: Aggregate the trip data by start_station_id, count the trips, and order them by trip volume in descending order. Use LIMIT 3 to get the top three stations.

Step 2: Create Buffers Around the Top Stations
Objective: Create a one-kilometer buffer around the top three stations.
Query: Use the ST_Buffer function to create a 1,000-meter buffer around the top three stations' geometries. This will create a polygon representing the area within one kilometer of each station.

Step 3: Perform Spatial Join to Find Nearby Stations
Objective: Identify which stations fall within the one-kilometer buffer zones created in Step 2.
Query: Perform a spatial join using ST_Intersects to find stations that intersect with the buffer zones. This identifies stations that are within the one-kilometer radius of the top three stations.

Result:
This query returns all stations that fall within the one-kilometer buffer zones around the top three stations, helping to identify which stations can be replenished together on the same van trip.

Visualization:
You can visualize the buffers and the nearby stations in QGIS by loading the resulting table and displaying the buffer polygons along with the relevant stations within each buffer zone.

Summary:
Buffers create a spatial zone around stations.
Spatial joins identify which stations are within that zone.
The result helps optimize van routes by identifying which stations can be served together efficiently. 



***********************************************
Chapter: 5. Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Visualization
***********************************************

-----------------------------------------------
Spatio-temporal analysis
-----------------------------------------------
The goal is to combine spatial and temporal data to conduct a spatio-temporal analysis, which helps visualize and understand both where and when bike trips are happening. This combined approach can assist in decision-making regarding resource allocation, staffing, and station management.

Objective:
Group trips data by both half-hour time intervals and census tracts to create a table that shows trip patterns at specific times and locations.

Steps:

1. Use Spatial Join (ST_Within)
The first step involves assigning trips to census tracts based on the location of the bike stations.
Spatial Join: The ST_Within() function is used to match bike station locations (from stations table) with census tract boundaries (from nyct2020 table).

2. Group Data by Time and Location
Group the data by:
Half-hour time intervals (e.g., 00:00-00:30, 00:30-01:00).
Census tracts (identified by their unique census_tract_id).
The GROUP BY clause ensures that the data is grouped by both start time and census tract, allowing for a count of trips (trip_count) in each combination.

3. Create the Query and Table
The table will contain four columns:

Half-hour time interval.
Census tract identifier (census_tract_id).
Geometry of the census tract (for mapping later).
Trip count for each combination of time and census tract.

Resulting Table: The table spatio_temporal_visualization will have:
Time intervals.
Census tracts.
Census tract geometries.
Trip counts per census tract for each time period.

The table is now ready for visualization, such as creating a choropleth map or animation to show trip patterns over time.

Conclusion:
Spatio-temporal analysis provides a comprehensive view by combining both when and where trips are happening.
This table can be used for creating visualizations (e.g., animated maps) to better understand and present trip patterns to stakeholders.

Video: Visualize time series data in QGIS with choropleth map
-----------------------------------------------
To visualize time-series data using a choropleth map and create an animation in QGIS, follow these steps to map out trip volumes by census tract and time of day. This method will help convey how bike trips vary over time across different locations.

Steps to Create the Time-Series Visualization:

Load the Data into QGIS:
First, refresh your database connection and load the table spatio_temporal_visualization_05_01 into QGIS by double-clicking it.

Create a Choropleth Map:
Right-click on the table layer in the QGIS Layer Panel and select Properties.
Under the Symbology tab, set the style to Graduated (for visualizing the trip_count column).

Click Classify, and then check the Histogram to see the distribution of trip counts.
If the data is skewed (as it often is), change the Classification Mode from Equal 
Count to Natural Breaks to better capture the variations in the data.

Apply the classification and adjust the number of classes (e.g., set it to 8 classes) to make the differences in trip counts more noticeable.

Enable Temporal Control:
Go back to the Properties window and click on the Temporal tab.
Enable Dynamic Temporal Control, and use the half-hour start time column in your data to control the animation.
Set the Event Duration to 1 day since the data represents one day of trips.
Click OK to apply these changes.

Set Up the Temporal Controller:
In the top menu bar, enable the Temporal Controller panel by clicking on View > Panels > Temporal Controller.

The map will disappear as the animation range is set to today's date. Change the start date to the relevant date in your dataset (e.g., September 17th).
Set the Step size to half an hour, which matches the temporal resolution in your data.

Animate the Map:
You will now see an animation of bike trip starts across census tracts throughout the day.

To improve the map’s context, add a base map:
Go to Web > QuickMapServices > OpenStreetMap Standard to add a base map for spatial context.
You can adjust the animation speed, make it loop, or even save it as a GIF or video.

Outcome:
You’ll have an animated choropleth map showing the distribution of bike trips across New York City’s census tracts, updated every half hour throughout the day. This dynamic visualization makes it easier to understand temporal trends and spatial patterns in the data, offering valuable insights for resource allocation and station management.
