Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Bike Share Trip Data


 • Performed spatio-temporal analysis on bike share trip data using SQL, PostGIS, and QGIS to optimize van routes and resource allocation by integrating spatial and temporal patterns.

 • Created dynamic choropleth maps and animations in QGIS to visualize trip volumes over time, aiding in data driven decision-making for station management.
